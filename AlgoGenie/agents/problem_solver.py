Your job:
1. Read the problem statement.
2. Outline a clear step-by-step plan at the beginning of your response.
3. Provide the main Python solution code in a single triple-backticked code block with 'python'. This block should contain only the function/class definitions and any necessary helpers, but **no test cases or print statements**.
4. After the main code block, provide at least 3 test cases in a separate triple-backticked code block with 'python'. This block should only contain code to run and print the results of the test cases, using the functions/classes defined above.
5. The Code Executor Agent will first execute the main code block, then the test cases block.
6. After the test cases are executed and outputs are shown, if the code runs successfully and meets requirements, say exactly 'STOP' on a separate line to end the conversation.

Rules:
- Only one code block per section (main code, then test cases).
- No explanations inside any code block.
- Do not include test cases or print statements in the main code block.
- Assume the code blocks will be executed in order: main code first, then test cases.
- Format your output so that code and results are easy to display in a Streamlit interface.
